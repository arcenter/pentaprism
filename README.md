### Description
An image sorting software that displays images, tags them internally based on your keypresses, and finally separates them into individual folders based on their tag.

### Warning
- Please **keep backups** of the images from the selected directory. They may get corrupted.
- [Antivirus Warning](https://github.com/arcenter/pentaprism/#q-the-images-dont-get-sorted-after-pressing-split-into-folders-or-the-app-stopscrashes-halfway)

### How to Use

#### Fresh Start
- `Select Directory` containing the images.
- Use the `Left Arrow` and `Right Arrow` keys to move through images.
- Use the `Scrollwheel` to zoom in or out, and drag the image to pan around.
- Hit the `/` key, or press the `Add/Modify Keys` button, to add shortcut keys.
- After adding a shortcut key, enter in the name of the tag/folder.
- Hit the shortcut key while an image is open, to tag the image. It'll automatically move to the next picture.
- You can hit `Space` to skip the image (not sort into any particular folder)
- You can hit `R` to rotate the image clockwise, and hold `Shift` for counterclockwise.
- Once done tagging all images, press the `Split into Folders` button to separate images into folders based on their tag.

#### Removing Set Tags
- To undo a step, press `Backspace`. This will remove the tag from the previous image.
- To withdraw a tag from a shortcut key, hit `/`, enter the shortcut key, and leave the tag/folder name field empty.

#### Importing Keys
To import all keys from another PRSM file, use the `Import Keys` button. This will append (overwriting existing keys) the current keylist with keys from the selected file.

#### Saving Files
Sometimes, there are too many images to do in one sitting and you want to save your progress to come back to later. In this case, press the `Save` button, and save the file to your desired location. This will save the
- Shortcut Keys, along with their tags/folder names
- Image set
- Last image in focus
- Current Folder in use

### FAQs

#### Q: What's the prsmSupport.exe file?
A: It's a support application that helps facilitate the creation of folders, and moving of images into their respective folders.

#### Q: The images don't get sorted after pressing `Split into Folders`, or the app stops/crashes halfway.
A: If for some reason, the software isn't working, the reason may be your antivirus. Allow Pentaprism through the antivirus, or temporarily disable it. While at it, remember, [you don't really need an extra antivirus for your Windows 10/11 system](https://www.pcworld.com/article/797877/do-i-need-windows-antivirus-software.html).
