### Description
An image sorting software that displays images, tags them internally based on your keypresses, and finally separates them into individual folders based on their tag.

### Warning
Please use at your own risk. Images may get corrupted, so keep backups of the image directory.

### How to Use

#### Fresh Start
- `Select Directory` containing the images.
- Hit the `/` key, or press the `Add/Modify Keys` button, to add shortcut keys.
- After pressing a shortcut key, enter in the name of the tag/folder.
- Press the shortcut key on any image, to tag the image.
- Once done tagging images, press the `Split into Folders` button to separate images into folders based on their tag.

#### Saving Files
Sometimes, there are too many images to do in one sitting and you want to save your progress to come back to later. In this case, press the `Save` button, and save the file to your desired location. This will save the
- Shortcut Keys, along with their tags/folder names.
- Image set
- Last image in focus
